things to do.


link status
individual reg set outstation
same from master
scan classes
master for each outstation link definition for one channel
how does outstation set a variable .. no need to do that
ERCOT dnp3 master we are an outstation pubs from outstation sent to local masters then to their outstations

put fims config 
look for only scan changed values ( not needed perhaps)

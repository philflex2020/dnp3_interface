things to do.


link status
individual reg set outstation
same from master
scan classes done and understood
master for each outstation link definition for one channel
how does outstation set a variable .. no need to do that
ERCOT dnp3 master we are an outstation pubs from outstation sent to local masters then to their outstations

put fims config 
look for only scan changed values ( not needed perhaps)



ERCOT Site
1/ setup outstation to receive and send data.
2/ outstation sends pubs on data updates ( )
    question 
            -> can we periodically scan for all outstation data.
            -> Yes if we can keep a copy of the data items in our syscfg structure.

3/ Fleet Manager has  master station or each outstation.
      -> master will get pubs (from 2) and set data items on the outstations.
      -> master will issue pubs to update status on Fleet Manager ERCOT outstation.
